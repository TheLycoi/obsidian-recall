# Recall — highlight-centric flashcards for Obsidian

Recall turns the sparse things you actually want to remember into Anki cards
without making you wait for the AI. It is built around three ideas:

1. **Highlights, not documents.** Every card belongs to a highlight: a span
   you selected, a `==markdown highlight==`, or a span the AI picked for you.
   The card writer only sees that span plus a little context, so it writes
   tight, grounded cards instead of a card for everything in the note.
2. **A flashcard inbox.** Sending a highlight is fire-and-forget. Cards are
   written in the background and land in an inbox you triage later, grouped
   by source note and by highlight, packed densely for fast scanning.
3. **Anki is the memory system.** Reviewed cards go straight into a deck via
   AnkiConnect (or a text-import file when Anki is closed). Nothing is
   rehearsed inside Obsidian.

## Workflow

```
read a note ──▶ select text ──▶ "Send selection to inbox"     (≈2 seconds)
                                        │
                     background: the model writes 1–5 cards for that span
                                        │
open inbox ──▶ scan / edit / delete ──▶ "Export" ──▶ Anki deck
```

### Capturing

**Highlighter mode** is the primary path. Click the pen in the ribbon (or run
*Toggle highlighter mode*), then drag across a passage. It is wrapped in
`==…==` and sent to the inbox with no key pressed. This works in the editor
(source and live preview), in reading view, and in Obsidian's PDF viewer,
where the highlight carries its page number instead of a line. The status bar
shows `🖊 highlighter` while the mode is on. Off by default: with it on, every
drag-selection is a capture. Guards: only a drag that started inside the
note or PDF counts, double-clicked words and selections under a minimum
length (setting, default 12 characters) are ignored, already-highlighted
spans are captured without being re-wrapped, and the same passage is never
captured twice in a row.

Commands, for when the mode is off:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Send selection to inbox** | Captures the selection (or the paragraph under the cursor; in reading view, the selected text), wraps it in `==…==`, and queues card writing. Also in the editor right-click menu. |
| **Send PDF selection to inbox** (also *…with instructions…*) | Captures the text selected in the PDF viewer with its page number and the page's text as context. |
| **Send selection to inbox with instructions…** | Same, plus a one-line instruction for the writer ("one cloze on the number", "cards in Dutch"). |
| **Send all ==highlights== in this note to inbox** | Sweeps a note you highlighted while reading and queues every span not already in the inbox. |
| **AI-highlight this note and write cards** | The "highlight" operation: the model picks spans worth remembering, each is verified verbatim against the note, marked, and queued. Use this for dense material. |
| **AI-highlight this note with instructions…** | Same, with guidance for the highlighter ("only definitions and numbers"). |

Every highlight remembers its note, line, nearest heading and (optionally) a
`^recall-…` block ID, so the inbox can jump straight back to the source. PDF
highlights remember the page and open the PDF at that page.

### What the cards look like

A worked example, from a vault note on Wozniak's minimum information
principle. Four highlights, four cards, nothing in an answer that isn't
stated in the span above it.

**Highlight** — *"Simplicity improves the accuracy of interval scheduling,
because recall of a simple item is closer to all-or-nothing."*

```
qa | Why does item simplicity improve interval scheduling?
   | Recall of a simple item is closer to all-or-nothing.
```

**Highlight** — *"Compound questions are split: 'What are the
characteristics of the Dead Sea?' becomes several specific questions
(location, salinity, why one floats, etc.)."*

```
cloze | A compound question like "What are the characteristics of the
      | Dead Sea?" should be split into {{c1::several specific questions}}
      | covering {{c2::location, salinity, and why one floats}}.
```

**Highlight** — *"a card repeatedly forgotten is often one that violates the
minimum information principle and should be split"*

```
qa | What is the usual diagnosis for a leech card?
   | It violates the minimum information principle and should be split.
```

The fourth card drafted from this note asked what the principle *is* and
answered by restating its definition — the near-tautology case the critique
pass looks for (`src/llm.ts:174-193`). It came back `drop`, so it sits in
the inbox flagged with its reason rather than being deleted, and cannot be
exported until it's fixed or kept deliberately.

Each exported card carries the verbatim highlight and an `obsidian://` link
in its extra field, plus a `source::<note-slug>` tag.

### Transcript-guided highlighting

Attach a lecture transcript to a note and the two **AI-highlight** commands
use it as evidence of what the lecturer emphasised, so the model prefers
spans the lecturer dwells on, repeats, calls important, or says will be
tested, instead of spreading picks evenly across the note. Spans are still
copied verbatim from the note; the transcript itself is never quoted.

Run **Add transcript for document highlighting** on an active `.md` note.
The modal shows the current transcript (origin, character count, added
date, whether it was cut to the size limit) when one is attached, and lets
you:

- Paste a transcript into the textarea.
- **Choose a file from the vault…**, which opens a fuzzy file picker
  restricted to `md`, `txt`, `vtt`, and `srt` files and reads the chosen
  file's contents into the textarea.
- **Save** the transcript (an empty textarea shows a notice instead), **Clear**
  it (only shown when a transcript already exists), or **Cancel**. `Cmd`/`Ctrl+Enter`
  in the textarea also saves.

Saving cleans the text before it's stored: WebVTT headers and `NOTE`
comment blocks are dropped, SRT cue numbers and `-->` timestamp lines are
removed, leading `[m:ss]`/`[h:mm:ss]`/`(m:ss)`/`(h:mm:ss)` timestamps are
stripped from the start of a line, and `<v>`, `<c>`, `<b>`, and `<i>` tags
are removed. Speaker `Name:` prefixes are left in place.

The **Transcript size limit** setting (default 150,000 characters) caps how
much of the transcript is sent to the highlighter; longer transcripts are
cut at a sentence boundary rather than mid-sentence.

Once a transcript is attached, both **AI-highlight this note and write
cards** and **AI-highlight this note with instructions…** pick it up
automatically, with no separate step, and the notice they show changes to
mention the transcript.

Limitations:

- Only markdown notes can be AI-highlighted, so a transcript attached to a
  PDF has no effect.
- Transcripts are keyed by the note's file path. Renaming or moving a note
  detaches its transcript; re-add it with **Add transcript for document
  highlighting** afterward.

### Digesting PDF highlights

If you take class notes by highlighting lecture PDFs with PDF++ — a callout
like `[[file.pdf#page=4&selection=2,0,33,19&color=yellow|…, p.4]]` or
`[[file.pdf#page=2&annotation=846R|…]]` plus its quoted text — Recall can
group those highlights by topic, write a short summary for each topic from
the whole paper, and lay out every highlight underneath it as the same
PDF++ callout, so clicking it still opens the PDF at that highlight.

Four commands, active on a PDF (or, for the last two, on a manifest note):

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Extract PDF highlights to manifest** | Collects every highlight of the active PDF — PDF++ links in notes that back-link to it, plus annotations embedded in the file itself — and writes a manifest, then opens it. |
| **Digest PDF highlights into topic notes…** | Asks the configured model to group the manifest's highlights into topic notes and write each one's summary, then shows a preview before writing anything. |
| **Digest PDF highlights from pasted model output…** | Same, but the draft comes from JSON you paste in rather than a live model call — see "Interim: digesting by hand" below. |
| **Ask the notes** | Opens the Recall sidebar in Chat mode (`src/main.ts:172-201`). |

**The manifest.** One file per PDF, in the folder set by **Manifest folder**
(default `recall-manifests/`), named after the PDF
(`<manifestFolder>/<pdf basename>.md`). It lists every highlight in page
order as a PDF++ callout carrying the same link the note would, plus
hand-readable fields (`id::`, `page::`, `kind::`, `color::`, `origin::`,
`before::`, `after::`) that the digest and the pasted-JSON path use to refer
to a highlight by its `id`. Re-running **Extract PDF highlights to
manifest** overwrites the manifest; it never touches a topic note
(`src/manifest.ts:173-187`, `src/pdfHighlights.ts`).

**The topic note.** Written to `<topicFolder>/<class code>/<title>.md`
(default topic folder `classes`; the class code comes from
`sources/class notes/<code>/` or is asked for once). Frontmatter links the
PDF, then a title, a short model-written summary, and every highlight
assigned to that topic as a callout in page order — subdivided by `### Page
N` when the note spans more than one page. Nothing but the summary and
title comes from the model; every link and callout is rendered by code
straight from the manifest. Two highlights on one page render exactly like
this (`src/topicNote.ts:47-73`):

# Receptors

## Summary
Receptors bind drugs with high affinity and transduce a signal, which is what separates them from inert binding proteins such as albumin; the better the structural fit, the higher the affinity.

## Highlights

> [!PDF|yellow] [[HBIO 250 - Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics, and Pharmacokinetics.pdf#page=4&selection=2,0,33,19&color=yellow|p.4]]
> > Receptors have 2 important properties: 1. They bind ligands (or drugs) with relatively high affinity, and after they bind a drug… 2. They transduce a signal to produce a biological effect (this property distinguishes receptors from inert binding sites – e.g., albumin – a blood protein that binds/carries many drugs but does not transduce a signal)

````

**Product: Notes / Flashcards / Both.** Every digest run asks which product
to build (default **Notes**). **Flashcards** skips the model call entirely
and queues every highlight with text straight into the inbox, where the
usual writer, critique, and lint chain handles cards. **Both** writes the
topic notes and also queues each written note's highlights into the inbox.
`(src/digest.ts:187-307`, `src/capture.ts` — `captureManifestHighlights`.)

**Never overwritten.** Writing into a topic note that already exists only
appends: a highlight already present — identified by its link's
`highlightKey`, i.e. the page and selection/annotation/rect, ignoring color
— is skipped, and the note's summary and related topics are left exactly as
they are. A note with no `## Highlights` heading gets one inserted before
`## Related topics` (or at the end, if there is no such heading), so a
manually written note gains a highlights section without disturbing what's
already in it (`src/topicNote.ts:152-212`).

**Preview.** Before anything is written, a modal lists every proposed note:
a checkbox (unchecked by default when an existing note would gain nothing),
a `new` or `exists: +added, skipped` badge, the target path, the summary,
the highlights as a compact list (skipped ones struck through), and related
titles. Titles are editable inline, which can move a note between "create"
and "merge into an existing note". Nothing is written until you click
"Write N notes"; Cancel or Esc touches no file.

#### Interim: digesting by hand

No model provider is required to work with manifests and topic notes end to
end — while none is configured (or while a configured one is failing), run
the digest by pasting a model's output instead of calling one from inside
Recall:

1. Run **Extract PDF highlights to manifest** on the PDF. The manifest opens.
2. In a chat session with a model of your choice, paste the system prompt
   below (`DIGEST_SYSTEM`), then this instruction, followed by the
   manifest's body and, if you want it, the PDF's text:

   > Below is a manifest of highlights from one lecture PDF, followed by the
   > paper's text. Return only a JSON object of this shape:
   > `{"notes":[{"title":"…","summary":"…","highlight_ids":["H01"],"related":["…"]}],"unused_ids":["…"]}`.
   > Refer to highlights by the `id::` in each callout. Do not write links or
   > callouts. Existing notes in this class: <titles in classes/<CODE>/>.
   > Write at most 6 notes.

3. With the manifest still the active file, run **Digest PDF highlights
   from pasted model output…**, paste the JSON back in, review the preview,
   and write. Recall renders every link and callout itself from the
   manifest — the model never writes one.
4. Ask (below) works without a model for the evidence half of an answer; a
   model answer needs a configured provider.

<details>
<summary><code>DIGEST_SYSTEM</code> (the digest system prompt, verbatim)</summary>

```
You turn one lecture PDF and the highlights a student made in it into a handful of topic notes. You are given the paper's text, so that you can see what each highlight is about, and the highlights themselves, each with an id and a page. You return, for each topic, a title, a short summary, and the ids of the highlights that belong to it. You never write links, callouts, or ids into your prose: the plugin renders each highlight back into the note from its own record, and prose that mentions H04 will be read by a person, not resolved by a machine.

<what_a_topic_is>
A topic is something the reader would look up by name later: a mechanism, a classification, a definition together with what follows from it, a distinction between two things that are easy to confuse. It is not a slide, not a section of the deck, and not the lecture itself. One lecture usually holds two to six of them. Fewer, larger topics beat many thin ones, because a note with one highlight in it is a note the reader will never open twice.

Every highlight belongs to the topic it serves best, and a highlight may serve more than one: a definition of affinity can sit under both the receptor topic and the dose-response topic, and putting it in both is right when a reader arriving at either would want it. What does not belong in any topic goes in unused_ids: slide titles, course logistics, dates, a name on a title page, a rectangle whose text came out empty. Leaving such a highlight in a topic costs the reader more than dropping it, because it dilutes the note it lands in.

You are told which notes already exist for this class. When one of those titles is the topic a group of highlights belongs to, reuse the title exactly, character for character, because the plugin then appends those highlights to that note instead of creating a second one beside it. Reuse it only when it genuinely fits; a near-match that forces unrelated highlights together is worse than a new note.
</what_a_topic_is>

<the_summary>
Three to five sentences about this topic, drawn from the whole paper but weighted toward what the reader chose to highlight. The highlights tell you what they cared about; the rest of the paper tells you what those highlights mean, and lets you write the sentence that connects two of them. Write in the reader's language, the one the paper is written in, and keep close to its wording so the summary reads as their own note rather than as a stranger's gloss.

Nothing from outside the paper. If you know more about the subject than the paper says, that knowledge does not belong here: the reader will study from this note and cannot tell your additions from theirs. No citations, no links, no highlight ids, no page numbers in the prose. The highlights appear underneath the summary in the finished note, so the summary does not need to quote them; it needs to say what they add up to.
</the_summary>

<titles_and_related>
A title is a short noun phrase in Title Case, the way an index entry reads: "Receptor Binding", "First-Pass Metabolism", "Stages of Change". Not a sentence, not a question, and unique within your response. Two titles that differ only in case or in a plural are the same title, and one of the two notes will be lost.

related lists the titles of other notes you are writing in this response, or of the existing notes you were shown, and nothing else. An invented title points at a note that does not exist. Leave it empty when nothing connects.
</titles_and_related>

<examples>
<example>
<input>Highlights H01 "Pharmacology, Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics — HBIO 250 Fall 2026" (p.1), H02 "Pharmacology is the study of the action of drugs in the human body" (p.2), H03 "Pharmacodynamics = what drugs do in the body; pharmacokinetics = what the body does to drugs" (p.2), H04 "Receptors bind ligands with relatively high affinity" (p.4), H05 "Receptors transduce a signal to produce a biological effect; this distinguishes them from inert binding sites such as albumin" (p.4). Existing notes: Pharmacology.</input>
<output>Two notes. "Pharmacology" (reusing the existing title) takes H02 and H03, with a summary that defines the field and sets its two branches against each other. "Receptors" takes H04 and H05, with a summary that names the two properties and says why the second one is what separates a receptor from a carrier protein. related on each names the other. H01 is a slide title and goes to unused_ids.</output>
<note>Five highlights, two topics, one dropped. The existing title is reused verbatim so the two highlights land in the note the reader already has.</note>
</example>
<example>
<input>Twelve highlights, of which nine are on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion, two are on the definition of half-life, and one is a rectangle with no text.</input>
<output>Two notes, not four. "Drug Disposition" takes the nine, because absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion are the four stages of one process and a reader looking any of them up wants the others in view; "Half-Life" takes the two, and also takes one of the excretion highlights, since half-life is defined there. The empty rectangle goes to unused_ids.</output>
<note>Splitting one process into four notes of two highlights each would make four notes nobody opens. One highlight sits in two notes because it belongs in both.</note>
</example>
</examples>

Before returning, check your answer against the input: every id you used appears there, every id in the input appears either in exactly the notes it belongs to or in unused_ids, no note has an empty highlight_ids list, no two titles collide, every related title is one you wrote or were shown, and no summary contains a link, an id, or a fact the paper does not state.
```

</details>

### Ask

A chat panel in the Recall sidebar (toggle **Inbox | Chat** in the header,
or run **Ask the notes**), for asking questions against the topic notes the
digest has written.

Retrieval is lexical, not an embedding or a vector store: every `.md` under
the **Topic notes folder** is indexed into evidence units — every highlight
callout/embed under `## Highlights`, plus any bullet under `## Key claims`
that ends in a wikilink — scored against your question with Obsidian's own
`prepareSimpleSearch`, plus a smaller weight for a match in the note title.
The best matches (setting **Evidence per question**, default 12, capped at
half from any one note) are numbered `[1]…[k]` and sent with your question
and the last few turns of conversation (**Conversation turns kept**,
default 10) in a single model call. The answer comes back citing `[n]`
after each sentence it supports; a citation outside the evidence range is
stripped mechanically before you see it. The evidence is then rendered
underneath the answer as the same PDF++ callouts (or a quote block, for a
claim with no PDF link) — clickable into the PDF or the source note, same
as in a topic note (`src/retrieval.ts`, `src/chatPanel.ts`).

**Without a configured provider**, the model call fails and the panel shows
an error line — but the evidence list still appears beneath it, built and
ranked with no model involved, so the sources for a question remain useful
even with no provider at all.

<details>
<summary><code>ASK_SYSTEM</code> (the Ask system prompt, verbatim)</summary>

```
You answer a student's question about their own class notes, using numbered evidence taken from those notes. Each piece of evidence is something they highlighted in a lecture PDF or a claim they wrote down themselves, and it carries the note it came from and the page it was highlighted on. Your answer goes into a small sidebar beside their notes, with the evidence listed underneath it, so the reader can check every sentence you write against the passage it came from.

<answer_only_from_the_evidence>
The evidence is the whole of what you may assert. You know a great deal about most of these subjects, and none of it belongs in the answer: the reader is revising for an exam set on this material, and a true sentence their course never taught them is one they cannot rely on and cannot trace. When the evidence answers the question, answer it. When the evidence answers part of it, answer that part and say plainly which part is missing, naming what would settle it ("the evidence here defines affinity but says nothing about how it is measured"). When the evidence does not touch the question at all, say so in a sentence and stop. That is a useful answer: it tells the reader their notes have a hole in them, which is what they would want to know.

Cite by writing [n] immediately after the sentence the evidence supports, with n the number in front of that piece. A sentence resting on two pieces carries both, as [2][5]. Every sentence that asserts something carries at least one citation; the only sentences that do not are the ones saying that the evidence is missing or thin, since there is nothing to cite for an absence. Never invent a number: if the evidence stops at [8], there is no [9].
</answer_only_from_the_evidence>

<how_to_write_it>
Prefer the reader's own wording. These are their highlights, in the vocabulary their lecturer used, and an answer in that vocabulary is one they can match against the slide. Where two pieces of evidence use different words for the same thing, use the one the question used.

Be short. A few sentences, or a small list when the question asks for several things. This is a sidebar, not an essay, and the evidence is right there underneath; you do not need to quote it at length, only to say what it means for the question. Plain markdown, bold and code at most, no headings.

The conversation so far, when there is one, is there so that a follow-up makes sense: it tells you what "it" refers to and what has already been said. It is not evidence. Nothing from an earlier turn may be asserted in this one unless the evidence in front of you now supports it.
</how_to_write_it>

<examples>
<example>
<evidence>[1] (Receptors, p.4) Receptors have 2 important properties: they bind ligands with relatively high affinity, and they transduce a signal to produce a biological effect (this distinguishes receptors from inert binding sites such as albumin, which binds and carries many drugs but does not transduce a signal).</evidence>
<question>What distinguishes a receptor from albumin?</question>
<answer>Both bind drugs, but only a receptor transduces a signal to produce a biological effect; albumin binds and carries drugs without transducing anything, which is why it counts as an inert binding site [1].</answer>
<note>One sentence, one citation, in the note's own words. Nothing is added about albumin's structure or its other roles, true though that would be.</note>
</example>
<example>
<evidence>[1] (Pharmacology, p.2) Pharmacokinetics = what the body does to drugs. [2] (Drug Disposition, p.7) Metabolism converts drugs into more water-soluble forms for excretion.</evidence>
<question>What is the half-life of aspirin?</question>
<answer>Your notes do not cover this. The evidence here defines pharmacokinetics [1] and describes metabolism in general terms [2], but nothing in it gives a half-life for aspirin or any other drug. If half-life was on a slide, it has not been highlighted yet.</answer>
<note>The gap is named rather than filled. The two citations describe what the evidence does say; the claim about aspirin's half-life is never made, because no evidence carries it.</note>
</example>
</examples>

Before answering, read back what you wrote: every [n] is a number you were actually given, every asserted sentence carries one, and nothing in the answer is something you know rather than something the evidence says.
```

**Settings**, all in Settings → Recall:

**Limitations:**

- Embedded PDF annotations and rect embeds need the pdf.js text layer's
  per-character geometry; without it they carry a page and a link but no
  text.
- `selection=` indices assume PDF++'s text-layer divs line up with pdf.js's
  `textContent.items`; the callout's quote is authoritative and a mismatch
  only produces a warning.
- Merging into an existing topic note only appends highlights — its summary
  and related topics are never edited by a later digest run.
- Retrieval is lexical: a question phrased with none of a note's own words
  will find nothing there. The evidence list is what makes that visible.
- No live model call for digest or Ask has been exercised yet; both prompts
  are covered by message-assembly and schema tests, and the digest path end
  to end by the pasted-JSON route.
- Handwritten professor annotations on scanned decks are images, not
  extractable text, and are out of scope.

**Where the Karpathy LLM Wiki plugin fits.** It is a consumer of the notes
this feature writes, never their producer. Its ingest pipeline only writes
`entities/`, `concepts/`, and `sources/` pages from a fixed prompt with no
custom page template, converts a whole PDF to markdown rather than reading
its annotations, and reports provenance at the source level only (never a
page or a selection) — none of which is what a PDF++-highlighting workflow
needs. Recall's topic notes are ordinary markdown with wikilinks, so once
written they can still be ingested by that plugin like any other note; they
are simply produced here, by a tool built to read the highlights PDF++
leaves behind.

### Card quality

Every card goes through a fixed chain before it reaches the inbox: the
writer drafts, a critique pass reviews the draft, and a deterministic
linter checks the result. The linter always runs and costs nothing; the
critique is on by default and can be turned off. All of this happens
inside the background queue
(`Generator.run` in `src/generator.ts`), so capture itself never waits on
it — a highlight just takes a little longer to turn into ready cards when
the critique is on.

**Critique pass** (setting, on by default) sends the whole set of cards
drafted for one highlight to the model in a single call and gets back a
verdict per card: `keep`, `revise`, or `drop`, plus the Bloom level the card
sits at (`src/llm.ts:44-58`, `src/llm.ts:162-237`). It checks grounding
(every answer and cloze deletion must be stated in the highlight), whether
the cards interfere with each other (two cards whose questions read alike
but want different answers, or that share an answer), and near-tautology
(an answer that just restates a word already in the question)
(`src/llm.ts:174-193`). A `revise` verdict replaces the card's fields and
records the reason on `critiqueReason`; a `drop` verdict does not delete
the card — it sets `status: "flagged"` and keeps the reason attached
(`src/generator.ts:95-110`). If the critique call fails (network, quota),
the drafted cards are kept as written and simply skip critique rather than
being lost (`src/generator.ts:112-117`). To avoid spending a model call on
a highlight that clearly doesn't need one, the critique is skipped when a
highlight drafts zero or one card and that one card already lints clean
(`src/generator.ts:82-84`).

**Bloom level** is the critique's judgment of how much a card actually
asks of the reader, reported using Bloom's taxonomy: a six-level ladder of
cognitive demand running remember → understand → apply → analyze →
evaluate → create. The one failure this is meant to catch is a highlight
that explains a mechanism or a reason getting turned into a card that only
asks what something is called — the reader can recite the label back
without knowing how the thing works. This is not a push toward the higher
end of the ladder: a highlight that states a plain definition and nothing
more is correctly a "remember" card, and the critique says so rather than
asking for a harder question the source doesn't support
(`src/llm.ts:185`, `src/model.ts:31-32`).

**Deterministic lint** (`src/lint.ts`) runs on every card regardless of
whether the critique is on, both on the freshly drafted cards and again on
any card the critique revised, since a revision changes the text the
grounding check needs to see (`src/generator.ts:79`, `:105`). It is pure
regex- and word-count-based, no model call. Nine checks can fail a card:

| id | what it catches |
| --- | --- |
| `cloze-not-grounded` | a `{{cN::…}}` deletion whose text isn't found in the highlight |
| `cloze-count` | a cloze card with fewer than 1 or more than 3 distinct deletions |
| `cloze-numbering` | deletion numbers that skip (e.g. 1, 3, no 2) |
| `cloze-framing` | a deletion body over 6 words, or one containing a linking word like "is"/"which"/"because" — a sign it hides a clause, not a short atom |
| `qa-empty` | an empty question/answer, or a cloze card with no deletion at all |
| `qa-answer-long` | a Q&A answer over 12 words |
| `qa-yes-no` | a question starting with "is", "are", "does", "can", and the like |
| `card-long` | question + answer + cloze text together over 60 words |
| `answer-in-question` | the answer sits verbatim inside the question, so there's nothing to retrieve |

Two more checks are warnings rather than failures — they flag a card
without blocking it: `duplicate-card` (this card repeats a sibling drafted
in the same batch) and `shared-answer` (two Q&A cards in the same batch
have the same answer, which risks confusing them in review). Labels for
all eleven ids, shown in the inbox, live in `LINT_LABELS` in `src/lint.ts`.

**The three settings**, all in Settings → Recall → Card quality:

| setting | default | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critique pass | **on** | runs the critique described above; adds one model call per highlight |
| Lint mode | badge only | what happens to a card that fails a lint check: badge it but keep it pending, collapse it behind a "N flagged" toggle, or flag it so it can't be exported |
| Learn from my decisions | **on** | shows the writer and critique a few cards you kept or edited, and a few you deleted, from your own inbox history |

The quality chain is on by default, because a card you delete during review
cost more than the model call that would have caught it. The linter is free
and always runs. The critique costs one extra model call per highlight;
turn it off if you are drafting in bulk and would rather triage by hand.

Lint mode stays at **badge only** by default, which is the conservative
choice: a card that fails a check is still yours to keep. Nothing in this
chain ever deletes a card (`src/settings.ts:99-101`).

The cost of turning the critique on is time, not capture speed: it is one
extra model call per highlight, so cards take longer to appear after you
send a highlight. Capture — selecting text, dragging with the highlighter,
sending a PDF selection — is unaffected either way, because everything
above happens in the background queue after capture has already returned
(`src/settings.ts:279`).

A **flagged** card (`status: "flagged"`) is one the critique dropped or
that failed lint under a mode other than "badge only". It stays in the
inbox with its reason attached rather than being deleted — nothing is
silently thrown away — but it is excluded from export: only cards with
`status === "pending"` are ever sent to Anki, whether through AnkiConnect
or the text-file fallback, so a flagged card cannot reach Anki until you
review and fix it (`src/model.ts:9`, `src/main.ts:284-292`).

### Triage

Open the inbox from the ribbon, the status bar (`Recall ✎ 2 · ⧉ 7` = 2
writing, 7 to review), or the **Open inbox** command.

- Cards sit beside the highlight they came from. Click the highlight to open
  the note at that line.
- Per card: edit in place, delete, rewrite with an instruction, convert
  Q&A ⇄ cloze. A cloze whose deletions are not found verbatim in the
  highlight gets a *not in highlight* badge (a deterministic check, no model).
- Per highlight: export, write more cards, add a card by hand, retry, dismiss.
- Per note: export everything reviewed from that note.
- Keyboard: `j`/`k` move, `e` edit, `x` delete, `o` open source,
  `Enter` export the focused highlight, `⌘⏎` export everything reviewed.

### Exporting

- **AnkiConnect** (default): Anki must be open with the
  [AnkiConnect](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) add-on. Recall
  talks to it through Obsidian's own request layer, so no CORS origin needs
  whitelisting. Duplicates are checked per deck before adding.
- **Text file** (fallback): *Inbox menu → Export reviewed as Anki text file*
  writes a tab-separated file with `#notetype`/`#deck`/`#tags` directives into
  `recall-exports/`; import it with *File → Import* in Anki.

Cards are tagged `recall` and `source::<note-slug>`. The `source::` tag is the
namespace the Anki Wiki Sync add-on resolves back to vault pages, so synced
deck pages link to the note the card came from. The extra field carries the
verbatim highlight and an `obsidian://` link to the source.

## Setup

1. Settings → Recall → **Provider**. Two options:
   - **Codex (ChatGPT subscription)** — no API key. Recall runs OpenAI's
     Codex CLI (`codex exec`) signed in with your ChatGPT account. Leave
     *Codex CLI path* empty and Recall finds `codex` on the PATH or the copy
     bundled inside the ChatGPT desktop app
     (`/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex`); otherwise paste
     the output of `which codex`. Sign in once through the ChatGPT app or
     `codex login`. Default model `gpt-5.5`; effort levels the model does not
     support are rounded down. Each request runs in a throwaway temp folder
     with a read-only sandbox, `--ephemeral` (no session files) and
     `--ignore-user-config` (your `~/.codex/config.toml` hooks, plugins and
     MCP servers are not loaded), so the agent never sees the vault.
   - **Anthropic (API key)** — paste a key, or leave the field empty and
     Recall reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from the environment or from the macOS
     keychain (a generic password whose service is `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or
     `Recall Anthropic API key`). The keychain route keeps the key out of
     `data.json`, which iCloud syncs in plaintext:
     `security add-generic-password -s ANTHROPIC_API_KEY -a recall -w`.
     Default model `claude-opus-5`.

   Effort defaults to `high` (highlights are small, so this is cheap). Click
   **Test** to confirm the provider answers.
2. Open Anki, then Settings → Recall → **Detect** note types. Recall prefers
   `Janus - Basic (v2)` / `Janus - Cloze (v2)` when present, otherwise
   `Basic` / `Cloze`, and maps the front/back/extra fields.
3. Pick a default deck (the inbox header lets you change it per session).

## Development

```
npm install
npm run dev            # watch build → main.js
npm run build          # type-check + minified bundle
npm test               # unit tests for the pure helpers
npm run install:vault  # build and copy into the vault's .obsidian/plugins/recall
```

State: settings in `data.json`, the inbox in `inbox.json`, both inside the
plugin folder. Notes are only touched when you choose to mark highlights.
